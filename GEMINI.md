# Gemini AI Assistant for Pathways Game

This document outlines the role and capabilities of the Gemini AI assistant in the development of the Pathways game.

## Role

I am an interactive CLI agent specializing in software engineering tasks. My primary goal is to assist in the development of the "Pathways" game by understanding the codebase, implementing changes, fixing bugs, and providing explanations.

## How I Can Help

*   **Code Understanding:** I can read and analyze existing code files (e.g., `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.css`, `.json`) to understand their functionality, structure, and conventions.
*   **Feature Development:** I can assist in adding new features to the game, such as new gameplay mechanics, UI elements, or integrations.
*   **Bug Fixing:** I can help identify and resolve issues within the codebase, ensuring the game functions as expected.
*   **Refactoring:** I can refactor existing code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance, while adhering to project conventions.
*   **Testing:** I can help write and run tests to ensure the correctness of new or modified code.
*   **Project Management:** I can assist with tasks like dependency management, script execution, and file organization.
*   **Code Explanation:** I can explain complex parts of the codebase, design patterns, or algorithms used in the game.

## How to Interact with Me

You can interact with me by providing clear and concise instructions. I will use the available tools (e.g., `read_file`, `write_file`, `replace`, `run_shell_command`, `glob`, `search_file_content`) to perform the requested tasks.

## Project Conventions

I will always strive to adhere to the existing project conventions, including:
*   **Styling:** Mimicking the formatting, naming, and overall style of the existing code.
*   **Structure:** Following the established file and directory structure.
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:** Using libraries and frameworks already present and utilized in the project (React, TypeScript, Vite).

Feel free to ask me any questions or assign me tasks related to the Pathways game development!
